# Wordfreak - CS230 Project 3

This is a program of the word counter (Word Freak) implemented using the C language. This program is able to take in various files and sorts them into a hashtable of BSTs and then prints them into an output.txt file in alphabetical order with the count right next to it.

My implementation fulfills the requirements of the project by:

-Implementing various BSTs that serves as the data structure that stores the words and the count of that word.
-Takes in a standard input, piping, environment, and normal arguments for files and reads them and inserts words accordingly into the hashtable.
-The hashtable is defined in the BST.h header file.
-Iteration is used to traverse the hashtables and BSTs in order to print, insert, write, etc.
-No disallowed C constructs are used in this project.
-Algorithms such as the findNode() search for similar looking words and increments count. 
-There are no global variables used in this project.
-Variable naming adequetely portrays what the function or variable is used for, such as readFile() which reads the file given in the input. 
-Various comments are written for each function, outlining what the function does.
-The standard "tab" spacing is used when coding within a function. Curly braces are used around a function to indicate the code within it.
